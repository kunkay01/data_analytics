Task 2 — Proposed data (sources & key fields)
(1) Rental price prediction

Listings data (ImmoScout24): title/description, monthly rent (CHF), rooms, living area (m²), floor, balcony/parking, building condition/year, address/ZIP, latitude/longitude (if available), listing date. (Explore the fields available per offer on immoscout24.ch as directed.) 

Excercises_Week_01

Municipality-level data (SFSO “Regionalporträts 2021: Kennzahlen aller Gemeinden”): population, households, median income/proxy variables, unemployment, age structure, housing stock, tax burden, area, density. 

Excercises_Week_01

Accessibility/context (optional enrichments): distance to nearest rail/tram stop, travel time to Zurich HB/Winterthur HB, POI density (schools, parks), noise zones (if available).

Rationale: Combine micro-level listing features with municipality context to capture both property attributes and location effects (fixed effects / embeddings).

(2) Supermarket demand vs. supply

Supply (OpenStreetMap, shop=supermarket): geometry (node/way/relation), brand/operator, opening hours (if present). Use OSM tagging guide as referenced. 

Excercises_Week_01

Demand (SFSO Regionalporträts): population, households, income proxies, age groups, employment, commuting flows (if available), car ownership proxies.

Accessibility: road network distances or simple centroid distances; optional public-transport reachability.

Rationale: Compute per-municipality supermarket count/density, coverage (within X km), and demand indicators; derive a gap index = f(population, households, income) – g(supermarket coverage).
